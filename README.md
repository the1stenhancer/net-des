Hello you reading this,
this is a github repo created by The1stEnhancer for the purpose of practising 
basic yet very important concepts in networking.
At the time of creation, it wasn't well documented but will make an effort 
to document from now on.
Hope you guys add more to this for those newbies (like myself) that are 
interested in learning basic network designs.
